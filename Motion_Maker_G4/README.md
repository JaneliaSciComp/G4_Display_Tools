# Motion_Maker_G4
A MATLAB tool for generating moving patterns for the 4th generation Reiser LED panel arena. Uses a coordinate-based pixel location system to create cylindrical gratings, edges, and starfields for all types of rotational and translational apparent motion.

Check the /support/coorindate conventions.pdf file as a reference for the coordinate systems used in these scripts. 

Recommended for use with newer versions of MATLAB (2016a and later); may have minor compatibility issues with older versions.
